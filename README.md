My first repository on GitHub
**introduction**_CoA provided me with coding challenges that involve array manipulation,string transformation and an interactive photo gallery UI task.
**Setup instractions**_To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory._Install the necessary dependencies by running._For the array manipulation challenge,run node array Manipulation.js._For string transformation challenge,excute node string transformation.js._To launch the interactive photo gallery UI,open index.html in your browser.
**Approach** _For array manipulation,let's consider an example:Given an array[1,2,3,4,5]I used a function to double each element,resulting in [2,4,6,8,10]_In the string transformation challenge,if we have the string"hello"my approach involved converting it to "HELLO"using uppercase transformation.
**UI challenge**:_In the interactive photo gallery task,I designed a gallery where users can click on images to view them in alarger size._For instance,click on a thumbnail of a nature photo would open a modal showing the full-size image with zoom functionality.
**Testing**:_To ensure accuracy,I created test cases for array manipulation like checking if the sum of elements after manipulation is correct._Similarly for string transformation I verified that the output string matches the expected transformed string.
**Conclusion**:_Throgh these challenges,I honed my skills in array manipulation,string handling,and UI development._The experience enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of front-end and back-end interactions.
